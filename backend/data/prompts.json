Review the current user message: [[userMessage]]. \n2. Analyze the retrieved previous conversation chunks from AI/User: [[retrievedChunks]]. \n\nNow, generate a **concise and precise** summary (maximum 50 words) while preserving only **relevant** information. \n\n**Format your output exactly as follows:** \n\n\"Previously, User and AI advisor (you must only include 'AI' or 'User' if they are mentioned in relevant chunks) discussed/asked (use appropriate verb) about 'insert summarized topic here with complete relevant context', which is relevant to the current user message.\"\n\nYour summary **must strictly follow** this format and be **clear, structured, and meaningful** in relation to the user's query. If the previous conversation chunks are not relevant to user input, just reply with \"None\"."
